returns graphics of comparison and an object called matConfOut which contains :

matConfPlot is a ggplot2 object showing the confusion matrix.
percAgg is the general agreement between the two sets of LCZ, expressed as a percentage of the total area of the study zone
pseudoK is a heuristic estimate of a Cohen's kappa coefficient of agreement between classifications

\title{Calls functions of the package to produce an analysis of two set of LCZ produced by GeoClimate.
Typically one will compare the LCZ produced by GeoClimate using the OSM data as input
to the LCZ produced by GeoClimate using the french BD_TOPO as input}
\usage{
produceAnalysis(
  location = "Redon",
  outDir = "/home/gousseff/Documents/3_data/GeoClimateSource",
  wf1 = "bdtopo_2_2",
  wf2 = "osm",
  refYear1 = "2022",
  refYear2 = "2022",
  repr = "brut",
  saveG = location,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{location}{defines the study area. The study area must have been coputed
and loaded on the cloud of the team. If the fetch function returns an error,
please contact the GeoClimate Team to make the data available}

\item{outDir}{is the directory in which the output will be saved,
namely the graphics and both LCZ for intersected geometries}

\item{wf1}{is the name of the workflow GeoClimate used to produce the first dataset It can be "osm" or "bdtopo_2_2"}

\item{wf2}{is the name of the workflow Geoclimate used to produce the second dataset It can be "osm" or "bdtopo_2_2"
If needed, future versions may allow other values}

\item{refYear1}{allows to indicate on which year the analysis was produced.
It is important for "osm" workflow as the data are updated frequently.}

\item{refYear2}{see refYear1.}

\item{repr}{: "brut" means that original values of LCZ are used, "grouped" means the user wishes to group some of the LCZ levels under a new label.}

\item{saveG}{: when an empty character string, "", the plots are not saved. Else, the saveG string is used to produce the name of the saved png file.}

\item{...}{allow to pass arguments if representation is grouped.
The expected arguments are the name of each grouped label,
the levels of LCZ they contain, and last a vector of the colors to use to plot them.}

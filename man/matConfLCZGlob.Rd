matConfLCZGlob(
  filePath = "",
  file,
  wf1,
  wf2,
  geomID1 = "",
  column1,
  confid1 = "",
  geomID2 = "",
  column2,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{filePath}{: the full path to the file to import}

\item{file}{: if filePath is an empty string file is the name of data set already loaded in the R session}

\item{wf1}{: a string indicating the origin of the LCZ classification 1}

\item{wf2}{: a string indicating the origin of the LCZ classification 1}

\item{sep}{: the seperator used in the csv file}

\item{repr}{: brut or grouped}

\item{niveaux}{: by default levels of the LCZ classification are built
reading the data, but one can input a character string vector of levels,
for instance to produce several graphs with the same levels or levels in a specific order}

\item{plot}{if TRUE, then confusion matrix plot is shown, else it is just returned in the matConfOut object}
}
\value{
matConfOut is a list containing the confusion matrix in its longer form, matConf,
a ggplot2 plot of said matrix called matConfPlot,
the summed area per levels for both LCZ classification called aires,
and the general agreement expressed in percent, pourcAcc

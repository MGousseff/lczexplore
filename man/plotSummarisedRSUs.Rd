\arguments{
\item{workflows}{contains the names of workflows (they will indicate the names of the columns containing LCZ levels)}

\item{plotNow}{: if TRUE the plot will be displayed in the session}

\item{graphPath}{: a valid directory path where th plot will be saved
(for now an empty string to avoid saving in the working directory)}

\item{whichPlot}{: if "totalAreaClust" the total aggregated areas per levels of LCZ will be plotted,
if "meanAreaClust", the trimmed mean will}

\item{aggregatedSF}{contains the geometry and LCZ levels}
}
\value{
the number of geometries (Reference Spatial units or RSUs)
and their mean area per level of LCZ, and the same after agregatting geometries
with same level of LCZ which touch each other

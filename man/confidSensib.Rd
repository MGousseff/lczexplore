\arguments{
\item{file}{is an R file with geom IDs, LCZ classifications and
a confidence value granted for the LCZ value of each geom. Ignored if filePath is not empty.}

\item{filePath}{is the path to a csv file containing geom IDs, LCZ classifications and
a confidence value granted for the LCZ value of each geom.}

\item{nPoints}{is the number of points (quantiles) of confidence for which
the average agreement between classifs will be computed}

\item{wf1}{is the name of the workflow used to produce the first LCZ}

\item{wf2}{is the name of the workflow used to produce the second LCZ}

\item{geomID1}{is the name of the column that contains the geom ID associated to the first workflow}

\item{column1}{is the name of the column storing the first LCZ classification values}

\item{confid1}{is the name of the column storing the first LCZ classification confidence value}

\item{geomID2}{is the name of the column that contains the geom ID associated to the second workflow}

\item{column2}{is the name of the column storing the second LCZ classification values}

\item{confid2}{is the name of the column storing the second LCZ classification confidence value}

\item{sep}{the separator used if filePAth is not empty}

\item{repr}{were the levels grouped or do we expect original LCZ values}

\item{niveaux}{levels of LCZ expected in both LCZ classifications}

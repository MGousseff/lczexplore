\title{Plots a tile graph of a confusion matrix between two sets of lcz on the same area}
\usage{
matConfPlot(
  matConfLong,
  marginAreas = NULL,
  column1 = "lcz_primary",
  column2 = "lcz_primary.1",
  agreeColumn = "agree",
  wf1 = "reference",
  wf2 = "alternative"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{column1}{is the name of the first classification}

\item{column2}{is the name of the second classification}

\item{agreeColumn}{is the name where the agreement between classification is stored}

\item{wf1}{is the name of the first workflow (for labels)}

\item{wf2}{is the name of the second workflow (for labels)}

\item{matConf}{is a dataframe for the matrice of confusion/agreement, in the longform :
first column is the LCZ level of the first workflow, second the level of the second workflow and
the third column the percentage of surface of the level of the first classification classified in the level of
the second classification}

\item{plotNow}{if TRUE the plot of the matrix is returned}

\item{saveG}{if not NULL will be the path in which the plot will be saved}

\item{...}{a set of unspecified arguments, for instance when the produceAnalysis function calls other functions}
}
\value{
returns a plot of a matrice of confusion
}
\description{
Plots a tile graph of a confusion matrix between two sets of lcz on the same area
}
\details{
Most of the time this function will not be called directly
by the user but by the compareLCZ function
}

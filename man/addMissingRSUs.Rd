\title{adds missing Reference Spatial Units (geometries) from the difference with a reference zone file,
and possibly add a value to the lcz column according to a reference workflow
reference spatial units nor represented by their own geometries
adding a column for location and workflow names}
\usage{
addMissingRSUs(
  sfList,
  missingGeomsWf = "iau",
  zoneSf,
  refWf = "bdt",
  refLCZ = "107",
  residualLCZvalue = "105",
  location,
  column = "lcz_primary"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sfList}{the list of LCZ sf objects}

\item{location}{the name of the location at which all LCZ are created}

\item{workflowNames}{sets the names of workflows and define the name of the files which will be loaded and intersected}
}
\value{
returns graphics of comparison and an object called matConfOut which contains :
matConfLong, a confusion matrix in a longer form,
matConfPlot is a ggplot2 object showing the confusion matrix.
percAgg is the general agreement between the two sets of LCZ, expressed as a percentage of the total area of the study zone
pseudoK is a heuristic estimate of a Cohen's kappa coefficient of agreement between classifications
If saveG is not an empty string, graphics are saved under "saveG.png"

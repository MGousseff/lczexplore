\title{Imports the LCZ produced by the WUDAPT algorithm.
For now, the function only allows import from the european tiff
produced by WUDAPT. Users MSUT DOWNLOAD the WUDAPT tiff file
at the following url : https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/European_LCZ_map/13322450
A future version may include the world data once a strategy is defined to deal with CRS.}
\usage{
importLCZraster(dirPath, zone = "europe", bBox, fileName = "EU_LCZ_map.tif")
}
\arguments{
\item{dirPath}{is the path to the directory where the}

\item{zone}{set to europe by default, may include world once a strategy is defined}

\item{bBox}{bBox is the bounding box needed to crop the wudapt tiff file.
It can be produced bu the importLCZgen function}

\item{fileName}{is by default \'EU_LCZ_map.tif\' but can be changed for test prurposes. Will be useful when other zones will be added}
}
\value{
an sf file containing the geom and LCZ levels from the WUDAPT Europe tiff within the bBox bounding box

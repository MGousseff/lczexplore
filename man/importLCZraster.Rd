\title{Imports the LCZ classifications produced on raster maps.
For now, the european tif map produced by WUDAP is used as a reference example.
Users can DOWNLOAD the WUDAPT tiff file at the following url :

A future version may include examples with the world data once a strategy is defined to deal with CRS.}
\usage{
importLCZraster(
  dirPath,
  zone = "europe",
  bBox,
  fileName = "EU_LCZ_map.tif",
  LCZband = 1,
  LCZcolumn = "EU_LCZ_map",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{dirPath}{is the path to the directory where the}

\item{zone}{set to europe by default, may include world once a strategy is defined}

\item{bBox}{bBox is the bounding box needed to crop the raster file.
It can be produced bu the importLCZvect function. It can either be of class bBox or of class sfc}

\item{fileName}{is the name of the raster file (tif or geotif), by default \'EU_LCZ_map.tif\'.
Will be useful when other zones will be added}

\item{LCZband}{the band of the raster files contains the LCZ types. Can be a number or a band name (default = 1)}

\item{LCZcolumn}{the name of the column of the output sf File in which the LCZ types will be stored
(default = "LCZ")}

\item{confidenceBand}{the band of the raster files contains a measure of confidence.
Can be a number or a band name (default = "", that is no measure of confidence provided)}

\item{confidenceColumn}{the name of the column of the output sf File in which the confidences values will be stored
(default = "", no confidence value specified)}

\item{typeLevels}{indicates a named vector of the unique values contained in LCZcolumn,}
}
\value{
an sf file containing the geom and LCZ levels from theraster tiff within the bBox bounding box
}

\examples{
redonBbox<-importLCZvect(dirPath=paste0(system.file("extdata", package = "lczexplore"),
"/bdtopo_2_2/Redon"), file="rsu_lcz.geojson", column="LCZ_PRIMARY", output="bBox")

redonWudapt<-importLCZraster(system.file("extdata", package = "lczexplore"),
fileName="redonWudapt.tif",bBox=redonBbox)

# another way to get the bounding box when one explores a given city would be the use of the 
# getbb() function from the osmdata package. 
# This exaample requires the osmdata package and therefore is not executed here
# redonBbox<-osmdata::getbb("Redon")
# redonWudapt<-importLCZraster(system.file("extdata", package = "lczexplore"),
# fileName="redonWudapt.tif",bBox=redonBbox)

# another way to get the bounding box when one doesn't want 
#to compare to a vector map is to enter it's coordinates 
# and feed them to st_bbox() of the sf package. 

# the following example can only be executed when user has downloaded 
# CONUS-wide LCZ map and Training Areas on WUDAPT website
# sanDiegobBoxCoord<-st_sf(a=1:2, geom=st_sfc(
#st_point(c(-117.175198,32.707289)),
#st_point(c(-117.112198,32.750900)),crs = 4326

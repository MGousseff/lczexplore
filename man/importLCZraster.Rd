\title{Imports the LCZ classifications produced on raster maps, mainly by the WUDAPT algorithm.
For now, the function  import from the european tiff
produced by WUDAPT. Users can DOWNLOAD the WUDAPT tiff file
at the following url : https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/European_LCZ_map/13322450
A future version may include the world data once a strategy is defined to deal with CRS.}
\usage{
importLCZraster(
  dirPath,
  zone = "europe",
  bBox,
  fileName = "EU_LCZ_map.tif",
  column = "EU_LCZ_map",
  typeLevels = c(`1` = "1", `2` = "2", `3` = "3", `4` = "4", `5` = "5", `6` = "6", `7` =
    "7", `8` = "8", `9` = "9", `10` = "10", `101` = "11", `102` = "12", `103` = "13",
    `104` = "14", `105` = "15", `106` = "16", `107` = "17")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dirPath}{is the path to the directory where the}

\item{zone}{set to europe by default, may include world once a strategy is defined}

\item{bBox}{bBox is the bounding box needed to crop the wudapt tiff file.
It can be produced bu the importLCZvect function. It can either be of class bBox or of class sfc}

\item{fileName}{is by default \'EU_LCZ_map.tif\' but can be changed for test prurposes. Will be useful when other zones will be added}

\item{column}{indicates the name of the column containing LCZ values, all other}

\item{typeLevels}{indicates a named vector of the unique values contained in column,}
}
\value{
an sf file containing the geom and LCZ levels from the WUDAPT Europe tiff within the bBox bounding box
}

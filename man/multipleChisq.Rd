\title{Computes Cramer's V for all pairs of onehot encoded levels of input LCZ classifications}
\usage{
multipleChisq(sfInt, columns, nbOutAssociations, areaColumn = "area")
}
\arguments{
\item{sfInt}{an sf object with several LCZ classifications on the same (intersected) geometries,
typically an output of the createIntersect function}

\item{columns}{a vector which contains names of LCZ classification columns}

\item{nbOutAssociations}{the number of significant associations we want to extract, ie pair of levels
from two different workflows whose Cramer's V is high (association between LCZ 101 from workflow 1
and LCZ 101 from workflow 2 are exclude, for instance, but can be read from the cramerLong output)}
}
\value{
Cramer's V between pairs of levels, in a matrix (cramerMatrix) or long form (cramerLong),
and a dataframe with the nbOutAssociation most significant association
}

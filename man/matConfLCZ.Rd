\title{Produces a confusion matrix between two sets of lcz on the same area (geoms do not need to be the same)}
\usage{
matConfLCZ(
  sf1,
  column1,
  sf2,
  column2,
  repr = "brut",
  niveaux = as.character(c(1:10, 101:107)),
  plot = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sf1}{is the sf dataset containing the first lcz classification}

\item{column1}{is the column of the first data set containing the lcz to be compared}

\item{sf2}{is the sf dataset containing the second lcz classification}

\item{column2}{is the column of the second data set containing the lcz to be compared}

\item{repr}{brut allows to use the optimal color scheme to represent the original LCZ.
If set to grouped, the ... arguments must contain the name of the groups and
the names of the colors associated to these user defined groups}

\item{niveaux}{by default the levels of lcz incoded from 1 to 10 and 101 to 107.
When comparing grouped LCZ, the grouped levels have to be specified.}

\item{plot}{if TRUE the plot of the matrix}

\item{...}{}
}
\value{
returns an object called matConfOut which contains
matConfLong, a confusion matrix in a longer form, which can be written in a file by the compareLCZ function
and is used by the geom_tile function of the ggplot2 package.
matConfPlot is a ggplot2 object showing the confusion matrix. If plot=T, it is also directly plotted
aires contains the sums of each LCZ area
pourcAcc is the general agreement between the two sets of LCZ, expressed as a percentage of the total area of the study zone
}
\description{
Produces a confusion matrix between two sets of lcz on the same area (geoms do not need to be the same)
}
\details{
Most of the time this function will not be called directly by the user but by the compareLCZ function

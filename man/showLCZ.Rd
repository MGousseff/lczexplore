\title{Produces a simple representation of the LCZ contained in an sf file.}
\usage{
showLCZ(
  sf,
  title = "",
  wf = "",
  column = "LCZ_PRIMARY",
  repr = "brut",
  niveaux = "",
  cols = ""
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sf}{is the sf file which contains the LCZ column to be plotted.}

\item{title}{allows the user to set the title of the plot}

\item{wf}{is the workflow used to produced the LCZ. "bdt" and "osm" indicate
that LCZ were produced by GeoClimate using the BD_TOPO_V2 or the Open Street Map data as input, respectively.
If the LCZ were produced by WUDAPT, use "wudapt".}

\item{column}{is the column that contains the LCZ.}

\item{repr}{indicates if the sf dataset contains brute LCZ levels or grouped LCZ.
If "brut" then an optimal set of cols is used to produce the plotted map. Else, colors can be specified with the cols argument.}

\item{niveaux}{is a vector of strings specifying the name of the expected levels when repr is set to 'grouped'.
If \'niveaux\' is set to an empty string, then the unique values taken in the specified \'column\' will be used.}

\item{cols}{is a vector of strings specifying the colors of each levels of \'niveaux.\'
If cols is an empty string, or if the number of specified color is less than the number of levels in \'niveaux\',
random colors will be chosen.}
}
\value{
no object is returned, but plots of the LCZ levels are produced
}

Produces a simple representation of the LCZ contained in an sf file.

# On original LCZ levels, use the \'brut\' value for the \'repr\' argument.

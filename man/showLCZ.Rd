\title{Produces a simple representation of the LCZ contained in an sf file.}
\usage{
showLCZ(
  sf,
  title = "",
  wf = "",
  column = "LCZ_PRIMARY",
  repr = "standard",
  drop = FALSE,
  useStandCol = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sf}{is the sf file which contains the LCZ column to be plotted.}

\item{title}{allows the user to set the title of the plot}

\item{wf}{is the workflow used to produced the LCZ. "bdt" and "osm" indicate
that LCZ were produced by GeoClimate using the BD_TOPO_V2 or the Open Street Map data as input, respectively.
If the LCZ were produced by WUDAPT, use "wudapt".}

\item{column}{is the column that contains the LCZ.}

\item{repr}{indicates if the sf dataset contains standard LCZ levels,
or alternative values, like grouped LCZ.
If "standard" then an optimal set of cols is used to produce the plotted map.
Else, colors can be specified with the cols argument.

The values must at least cover the values of the column in the dataset, or it will be ignored.}

\item{drop}{indicates if you want to show the levels present in no geometry.}

\item{useStandCol}{is set to TRUE implies that any levels detected as a standard LCZ level will receive the standard associated color}

\item{...}{these dynamic dots allow you to pass arguments to specify levels expected in your dataset and colors associated to these levels}
}
\value{
no object is returned, but plots of the LCZ levels are produced
}
\description{
Produces a simple representation of the LCZ contained in an sf file.

\examples{
# On original LCZ levels, use the \'standard\' value for the \'repr\' argument.

# On grouped data, use the alter value for the repr argument.

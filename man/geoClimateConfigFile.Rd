\arguments{
\item{wf}{is the workflow used by GeoClimate. For now, only osm is available, for OpenStreetMap, but bdt for
BD TOPO of IGN should be added when an online database is available.}

\item{locations}{is either the town or the coordinates of the bounding box of the area on which GeoClimate will run.
If a town name, it will be fed to the Nominoe API, through the overpass API of OpenStreetMap.}

\item{forceSRID}{some BD TOPO input file may not have an srid, this forces srid to be 2154}

\item{outFolder}{indicates where the results of GeoClimate will be put}

\item{rsuIndics}{is a vector with the indicators one wants to compute at the RSU scale. The default is c("LCZ","TEB","UTRF"),}

\item{svSimplified}{uses the simplified method to calculate skyview factor, default = TRUE}

\item{estimatedHeight}{uses an algorithm to esitmate the missing building height, default = TRUE}

\item{grid_x_size}{is the x size for the grid if some grid indicators are to be computed, default=100}

\item{grid_y_size}{is the x size for the grid if some grid indicators are to be computed, default=100}

\item{rowCol}{if grid_x_size and grid_y_size are not set, one cal set the number of rows and cols throug rowCol,
but the recommended and defualt is FALSE}

\item{outputType}{is the format of GeoClimate outputs, default="geojson",}

\item{gridIndics}{is a vector containing the indicators to compute at the grid scale. Default is
c("BUILDING_FRACTION",
"BUILDING_HEIGHT",
"WATER_FRACTION",
"VEGETATION_FRACTION",
"ROAD_FRACTION",
"IMPERVIOUS_FRACTION","LCZ_PRIMARY","LCZ_FRACTION","UTRF")}

\item{outConfigDir}{is the folder were the resulting JSON file will be put, the folder where GeoClimate will read it from
(different from out outFolder, where GeoClimates will put its geoJSON ouputs), default is "/tmp"}

\item{outConfigFile}{is the name of your configuration file, if anb empty string, a name woill be created from location
and workflow parameters.}
}
\value{
returns a JSON configuration file to be fed to GeoClimate

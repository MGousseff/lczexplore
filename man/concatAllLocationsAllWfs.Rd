concatAllLocationsAllWfs(
  dirList,
  locations,
  workflowNames = c("osm", "bdt", "iau", "wudapt")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dirList}{the list of directories for which the different LCZ files will be intersected}

\item{workflowNames}{sets the names of workflows and define the name of the files which will be loaded and intersected}

\item{for}{each diretory from dirList, a location name must be fed to the function}
}
\value{
returns graphics of comparison and an object called matConfOut which contains :
matConfLong, a confusion matrix in a longer form,
matConfPlot is a ggplot2 object showing the confusion matrix.
percAgg is the general agreement between the two sets of LCZ, expressed as a percentage of the total area of the study zone
pseudoK is a heuristic estimate of a Cohen's kappa coefficient of agreement between classifications
If saveG is not an empty string, graphics are saved under "saveG.png"

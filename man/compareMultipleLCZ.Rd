\usage{
compareMultipleLCZ(
  sfList,
  LCZcolumns,
  refCrs = NULL,
  sfWf = NULL,
  trimPerc = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sfList}{a list which contains the classifications to compare, as sf objects}

\item{LCZcolumns}{a vector which contains, for eacfh sf of sfList, the name of the column of the classification to compare}

\item{refCrs}{a number which indicates which sf object from sfList will provide the CRS in which all the sf objects will be projected before comparison
By defautl it is set to an empty string and no ID is loaded.}

\item{sfWf}{a vector of strings which contains the names of the workflows used to produce the sf objects}

\item{trimPerc}{this parameters indicates which percentile to drop out of the smallest geometries resulting
from the intersection of the original sf geometries intersection.
It allows to account for numeric precision errors and to speed up computations at the cost of not considering the smallest geometries.}

\value{
returns graphics of comparison and an object called matConfOut which contains :
